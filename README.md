Data Science @ GT is Georgia Tech's premier Data Science club and this is our member portal! We use the following technologies:
1. ReactJS
2. Firebase
3. Travis CI

In order to run this, you will need access to our Firebase console. Once that is granted, run the code the following way:

1. cd frontend
2. npm i -s
3. npm start
