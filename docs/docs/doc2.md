Since this was a portal that served nearly 300 members (a number that we most definitely expect to grow), we chose the technologies used with scalability and reliability in mind, whilst trying to maintain a simple development lifecycle. 

We develop in an [Agile environment](https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/), and we recommend that anyone who wishes to join DSGT's Portal team as an Engineer, UX Designer, or Product Manager familiarize themselves with the methodology prior to starting in their roles.

The following are the technologies used for the member portal:

- ReactJS (Frontend)
- Firebase (Backend)
- Jest/Mocha (Tests)
- Git/Github (Version Control)
- Zenhub (Scrum board)
- Circle CI (Continuous Integration)
- Slack (Communication)

### Understanding the purposes of each technology

It is essential that the team understands exactly what tools are used for each process in the development process and also understand how to develop using those tools. Here is a layout of the DSGT Member Portal application:
1. **Frontend**: The frontend of the application is primarily built in React, an open source JS library for building UIs. Engineers are required to familiarize themselves with the library before jumping into building new features. Most of the time, the bulk of effort for a new feature goes into developing the frontend, so this is important!

2. **Backend**: As for the server side (the databases, cloud storage, cron jobs, and authentication), we use Firebase. This is an app development platform provided by Google which allows for application development without worrying about infrastructure. Again, please understand this before developing features as flow of data, server side calls, etc. all involve Firebase.

3. **Version Control**: We use Git as our VCS and Github as the git platform to host our codebase. Engineers are required to familiarize themselves with the Git CLI before jumping into development as integrating oneâ€™s changes into the repository is not possible without it.

Below are the links to the codebase, consoles, and dashboards that are part of the development process (NOTE: Engineers must be given access to these tools if they are to develop):
